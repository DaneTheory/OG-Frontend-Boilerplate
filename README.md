# OG Front End Boilerplate
###### TODO: Come up with sexier name.

A front-end dev boilerplate using all the new and shiny toys we love to use in development, ready to go out of the box. Quick start projects. No need to wire up tooling. Common industry development workflow built right in.

### Why?
Got a bunch of code challenges to get done. Needed something to help expedite the process.

### What's included?
#### * Gulp
Handles task automation like "dev to prod" build processes, file minification/concatenation/uglification, sourcemaps.
#### * Browser Sync
Saving files automagically refreshes the browser to show updated changes.
#### * Babel
Full ES6 support for writting code.
#### * HTML5
Included markup and structure set to best practices.
#### * SASS/SCSS
Programmatic styling. Write CSS smarter, not harder. Includes sourcemapping for easier styling during development.

###### TODO: Provide more robust documentation bruh.

## Cheers!
